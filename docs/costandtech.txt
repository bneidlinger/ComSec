1. Types of Vibration/Seismic Sensors for Security Cable Sheathing
A. MEMS Accelerometers
How they work: Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers detect vibration, tilt, and acceleration in multiple axes. They’re tiny (millimeter-scale), cheap, and available in high volume.

Features:

Low power

High sensitivity to small movements and vibration

Digital and analog output versions

Can be chained or addressable

Example chips:

Bosch BMA400, BMA456: Used in wearables, can run on μA-level currents, cost-effective.

STMicroelectronics LIS2DH12: Used in alarm tamper systems.

Unit price: $0.80–$3.00 in quantity (even less for massive volume, but $1–$2 is a good engineering estimate).

B. Piezoelectric Sensors
How they work: When physically deformed (by vibration, flex, or pressure), piezoelectric crystals generate a voltage. Very sensitive to knock/tap and used for percussion detection (e.g., glass break sensors).

Features:

Extremely sensitive to sharp impact (wire cut, drill, etc.)

Analog output, easy for threshold triggers

No power required for the element (but signal conditioning circuit needed)

Example:

Murata PKGS series, generic piezo discs.

Unit price: $0.20–$1.00 for the element, but requires amplifier/ADC on PCB.

C. Fiber Optic Vibration Sensing
How they work: Fiber optics detect minute changes in light transmission when the cable is disturbed. Used for long perimeters and fence security.

Features:

Immune to EMI, high reliability

Can monitor many meters with a single fiber

Expensive, but more secure/robust for long distances

Example:

AP Sensing, Senstar FiberPatrol (industrial products)

Unit price: $$$$ (specialty—hundreds to thousands per run; best for high-security, long-range, government/military).

D. Strain Gauges / Flex Sensors
How they work: Changes resistance when bent or flexed. Can be integrated for localized detection of cable deformation.

Features:

Simple, robust

Usually used for “tamper detection” at cable ends

Less sensitive to vibration, more to flex/cut

Example:

Spectra Symbol Flex Sensor

Unit price: $2–$5 for small segments.

E. Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)
How they work: Uses laser pulses through fiber optic cables, detecting acoustic disturbances along the length.

Features:

Monitors 10+ km

Used for pipelines, perimeter fences, but too bulky/expensive for “sheathing a comm line” in most commercial use cases.

Unit price: $$$$ (not practical for small/medium buildings).

2. Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Examples
Seismic Cable Security (Alarm Cable with Piezo or MEMS):

Bosch ISC-BDL2-WP12G uses MEMS for glass break and shock

Senstar (FiberPatrol, FlexPS) uses fiber and piezo for high-end applications

RMS Ltd. Vibration Cables: Piezo vibration cable for fence and wall detection

3. Practical Cost Estimates (2025, USD)
Sensor Type	Typical Cost/Unit	Notes
MEMS Accelerometer	$1–$3	Best balance for new design, low power, scalable
Piezo Element	$0.20–$1.00	Needs amplifier/PCB, analog only
Flex/Strain Sensor	$2–$5	For “cut/flex” but not vibration monitoring
Fiber Optic (Short)	$10–$50/meter	Only for high security, specialty
Fiber Optic (DAS)	$1000+/run	Industrial/govt perimeter, not for small cable

4. Integration & Bill of Materials (BOM) Example
Assume:

Sheath contains 10 MEMS sensors per 10 meters (one every meter, for fine detection)

MCU (Microcontroller for edge AI): $2–$5 per cable segment (ESP32, STM32, etc.)

Sheathing material (anti-cut/anti-drill): $2–$4/meter (Kevlar weave, etc.)

PCB and passive components per meter: $2 (amplifier, connectors, wiring)

Estimated BOM per 10 meters:

MEMS sensors: $15–$20

MCU/edge processor: $4

Kevlar sheath: $30

PCB, connectors: $20

Total: $70–$90 per 10 meters (manufacturing scale; prototype could be 2–3x higher)

Installation, enclosure, certification, and cloud/AI services are extra.

6. Summary Table: Pros and Cons
Tech Type	Cost	Pros	Cons
MEMS Accelerometer	Low	Cheap, scalable, digital, robust	Somewhat sensitive to false pos.
Piezo Element	Low	Very sensitive, simple	Needs analog, can be noisy
Fiber Optic	High	Long range, EMI immune, very secure	Expensive, complex
Strain/Flex	Low	Simple, robust, “cut” detection	Not great for vibration
